summary: I've been around CNCF community since my sophomore year of University, but thanks to COVID,  I never got the chance to hit up a KubeCon in person. But hey, guess who made it this time? Yours truly, soaking up all the vibes at KubeCon 2024 in Paris!

I've been around CNCF community since my sophomore year of University, but thanks to COVID,  I never got the chance to hit up a KubeCon in person. But hey, guess who made it this time? Yours truly, soaking up all the vibes at KubeCon 2024 in Paris! 

And let me tell you, when I stepped foot into that venue, my first thought was just, "Finally!" 😅

So, like, KubeCon kicked off on March 19th, but that day was all about this CNCF-hosted Co-located event that wasn't part of my ticket. Bummer, right? But hey, no biggie! I ended up wandering around Paris instead. And let me tell you, Paris totally rocks! It's bursting with energy and vibes, you've gotta experience it! 🇫🇷✨

### Let the adventures begin! 🚀

First day kicked off with the classic lineup for security, picking up my badge, and ditching my bags at the cloakroom. Then I went straight for a quick caffeine fix and croissant before diving into the schedule to locate the keynote room.

Let me tell you, the place was massive, but somehow I managed to make it to the keynote room just in time (okay, I was little late but, hey who's counting? 😉).

And folks, let me spill the beans on the awesome Keynote from KubeCon Paris!

This year's KubeCon in Paris was massive, with over 12,000 folks showing up- the biggest turnout yet! And guess what? It's a special year for all you Kubernetes enthusiasts out there because K8s will turn 10 later this year!

The theme for this year was around AI, and let me tell you, the buzz is real! Communities are already diving headfirst into building AI-enabled features, and it's absolutely mind-blowing!

I got super excited after catching the "Keynote: Welcome + Opening Remarks". But what really got me going was the next one - "Keynote: Accelerating AI workloads with GPUs in Kubernetes".

I've been geeking out over GPUs for the past few months, so you can imagine my excitement! And let me tell you, it didn't disappoint!

Each keynote brought a whole bunch of new perspectives, cool innovations, and wild ideas, one after the other. I learned a ton of stuff!

Plus, the CNCF kicked off this cool program called "Zero to Merge," which is awesome because it helps anyone learn how to contribute to CNCF projects. Great stuff for anyone diving into the open-source world!

Also there were award ceremony for exceptional end users in the ecosystem and guess who won this year? **CERN**! **Yay, go CERN!** 🎉

Then it was coffee o'clock again!☕

And oh boy, choosing which talk to hit up next was a real brain teaser! So many cool talks happening at once! But, after some serious thinking, I cracked the code!👩🏻‍💻

In between attending talks, I managed to meet new people—chatting about tools, cloud stuff, and communities ! ✨

Going to the Project Pavilion meeting, catching up with the maintainer, and snagging some cool swag was hands down one of the best parts for me! ❤️

By the time KubeCon wrapped up, I was beat! My fitness tracker was shocked – apparently, I walked more in those few days than I had in ages. But you know what? It felt awesome! 😊

Seriously though, those three days flew by in a blur of excitement. I can't believe how quickly it all went down. Attending in person this year was a game-changer. Catching up with talks and people gave me a whole new outlook on things. 💫

Alrighty, folks! Time to wave goodbye for now! Looking forward to future KubeCon(s) and other CNCF conferences. ❤️

À bientôt!👋
