Hi there! :wave: I'm Nivedita.

An Open-Source enthusiast and junior from India pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.

Currently I'm in Kubernetes 1.24 Release team.

Previously, I've done internship at [Digital Product School by UnternehmerTUM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/digital-product-school/), [Odyssey Cloud](https://www.linkedin.com/company/odyssey-cloud/about/) and also worked as a [Linux Foundation Mentee](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/35b9d57a-fc2c-4b49-a5b3-9a5cf74af66c) at [CNCF-OpenEBS](https://github.com/openebs).

I like to explore distributed systems, algorithms and open source. I love learning by working on Open-Source software and getting involved with the awesome communities around it.

Fun fact about me:ðŸ™ˆ

I prefer my pizza thick-crust, and if I will ever have a pet, it will be a Jasper!ðŸ’œ
