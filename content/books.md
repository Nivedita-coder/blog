Some of the books I have recently read. Hopefully you will find them enjoyable!ðŸ˜ƒ

- [Do Epic Shit](https://www.amazon.in/DO-EPIC-SHIT-Ankur-Warikoo/dp/9391165486) - 01/2022
>This book is about different aspects of life. Money, Relationships, Success and Failures, Entrepreneurship, etc. The book is designed to be read one page at a time, and you can pick any page to begin with. It is not a book that needs to decorate your bookshelf. It is a book that you need to place it on your work/study desk. Perfect for arousing motivation and positive vibes in you.
